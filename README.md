# Hello-World-new-beginning

Hello everyone!
Roy here just trying to get back into coding after being absence for several years
I'm an IT consultant who's mainly trying to learn powershell and being able to write my own scripts
now that I'm moving to Azure. Hope to grasp this language and be affective with my script learning/ writing.
